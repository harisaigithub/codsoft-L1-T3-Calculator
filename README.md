## Introduction

The basic calculator project was designed to implement fundamental web development skills including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This task aimed to provide hands-on experience with creating an interactive web application.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly design with clickable buttons for digits and operations.
- **Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Real-Time Calculation:** Displays input and results on the screen instantly.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes CSS Grid for flexible and responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout, including the use of CSS Grid for button alignment.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for handling user input and performing calculations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harisaigithub/codsoft-L1-T3-Calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd codsoft-L1-T3-Calculator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

3. The result will be displayed on the screen after pressing the equals button.

## Project Structure

```
/codsoft-L1-T3-Calculator
│
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file for styling the calculator.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that includes the logic for the calculator’s functionality.

## Development Process

1. **HTML Structure:** Created the basic structure with a display screen and buttons for numbers and operations.
2. **CSS Styling:** Applied styles to make the calculator visually appealing and used CSS Grid for button layout.
3. **JavaScript Functionality:** Added event listeners for button clicks, implemented the logic for arithmetic operations, and updated the display based on user input.

## Challenges Faced

- **Button Alignment:** Ensuring the buttons were evenly spaced and aligned correctly using CSS Grid.
- **Real-Time Display Updates:** Managing the real-time update of the display screen with user inputs and results.
- **Operation Logic:** Handling multiple sequential operations and ensuring accurate calculations.

## Conclusion

Completing this task was a significant learning experience, reinforcing my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project challenged me to apply these skills in a practical scenario, resulting in a functional and interactive web application.
